I also added some variables in PATH environment, related to Cygwin:
C:\cygwin64\bin

And also this in the System Variables:
CYGWIN_HOME
C:\cygwin64

And select bash.exe as an app to execute that script. So go to 'More apps' and select bash.exe (from Cygwin/bin) as an application to open that file.
